Microcontroller Timer Calculator
A comprehensive web application for precise microcontroller timer calculations and analysis, designed for embedded systems engineers and developers. This tool facilitates accurate computation of timer register values, TMOD configurations, and timing parameters.
Core Functionality
The application provides three specialized calculators:
1. Forward Calculator

Computes TH/TL register values from frequency inputs
Supports dual-mode operation:

Mode 1: Complete TH & TL register value calculation
Mode 2: TH register value calculation


Handles precise frequency inputs with automatic validation

2. TMOD Configuration Analyzer

Performs comprehensive Timer Mode register analysis
Features include:

Bit-level register visualization
Automatic mode configuration detection
Binary representation display


Provides detailed operational mode interpretation

3. Reverse Calculator

Derives timing parameters from register values
Offers two calculation modes:

Mode 1: Full analysis using both TH & TL values
Mode 2: Simplified analysis using TH value only


Generates precise timing metrics with microsecond accuracy

Technical Architecture
Frontend Stack

HTML5 for structural components
CSS3 with Custom Properties for styling
